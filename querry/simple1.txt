!..... first of all we have to create database by using create command
      1.create database database_name
      2.\l->it is used to show list of database
      3.\c database_name->select database
      4.\d table_name->it is used for description of table
      5.\dt->it is used to show all the table
      6.\q->for exist
      7.select ->it is used to select data from database and result will be stored in result_set
                  select * from table;
                  select column1,column2,....from table;
      8.select distinct->The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.
                        (select distinct column_name1,column2,... from table)
      9.where clause->it is used for giving the condition
           = 	Equal(select first_name from worker where department_id=2)
          <> 	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=(select first_name from worker where department_id<>2)
           > 	Greater than(select first_name from worker where department_id>2)
           < 	Less than(select first_name from worker where department_id<2)
          >= 	Greater than or equal(select first_name from worker where department_id>=2)
          <= 	Less than or equal(select first_name from worker where department_id<=2)
      BETWEEN 	Between a certain range (SELECT column_name1, column_name2,....FROM table_name WHERE  column_name1 BETWEEN value1 AND value2;)
        LIKE 	Search for a pattern(select first_name from worker where first_name like'%a')
         IN 	To specify multiple possible values for a column(SELECT column_name(s)FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...); 
   

!........querry on full outer join

       10.select worker.first_name,worker.last_name,worker.salary,worker.joining_date,title.worker_title from worker full outer join title on                           worker.worker_id=title.worker_ref_id;
      11.select worker.first_name,worker.last_name,worker.salary,worker.joining_date,title.worker_title,bonus.bonus_amount from worker full outer join title on       worker.worker_id=title.worker_ref_id full outer join bonus on worker.worker_id=bonus.worker_ref_id;
      12. select worker.first_name,worker.last_name,worker.salary,worker.joining_date,title.worker_title,bonus.bonus_amount,department.department_name from worker full outer join title on worker.worker_id=title.worker_ref_id full outer join bonus on worker.worker_id=bonus.worker_ref_id full outer join department on worker.department_id=department.department_id;
!.......querry on inner_join
      13. select worker.first_name,worker.last_name,department.department_name,bonus.bonus_amount from worker inner join bonus on worker.worker_id=bonus.worker_ref_id inner join department on  worker.department_id=department.department_id;
