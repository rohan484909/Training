	Mr. Modi perfected his theory within the confines of his state office, doubling and tripling every statistic that came to mind. <br>The theory was so baffling that even Dr. Manmohan Singh, the then (part) Prime Minister did not understand it completely,<br> even though he was an economist himself. It was only after Mr. Steven Spielberg, an acclaimed Hollywood director heard of <br>this theory through Mr. Anil Ambani, an Indian business tycoon and Mr. Modi fan, promised that he would use the theory on his <br>new science fiction movie; the world noticed.
